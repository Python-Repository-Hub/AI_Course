I don't need a doctor.
Tom told me you were afraid.
I live here alone.
When are you getting out of here?
I just think you should be more careful, that's all.
Everyone screamed.
I go for a walk every other day.
Respect your elders.
Are you looking for us?
What are you drinking?
Why do you always do that to me?
I thought you were broke.
He has a beard.
If you have questions, don't hesitate to jump in.
I like your tie.
Tom doesn't know how much Mary weighs.

He isn't at home, is he?
I'll get rid of them.
My parents come from China.
I've been a teacher for 15 years.
You don't sound convinced.
Cats catch mice.
So, what happened this time?
You're courteous.
He wrote to me from time to time.
Who can run fastest in your class?
I kept hoping I'd meet Tom.
She made cookies for the children.
The secret of life is hanging around until you get used to it.
Who are you to tell us we can't go?
He hesitated for a moment.
My tie is orange.
See what I mean?
She hit him.
Now I'm in trouble.
You have to speak English here.
I usually have dinner at seven.
You should've called.
I think you should check under the bed.

He needs an umbrella.
I invited my neighbor to breakfast.
Hey everyone, please listen.
He hit his head against a rock.
No one really cares.
Don't let them go to waste.
I just had this suit cleaned.
Clean up that mess.
Why did you come over here?
Did he do such things?
Once a species goes extinct, it's gone forever.
I was dizzy.
Had she known the results, she would have been shocked.
Why were you absent yesterday?
I'm too old for this.
My parents aren't home right now.

He collected bits of information.
Take care of yourself. Don't get sick.
This is a bus stop.
The weather was miserable yesterday.
Have any of your friends ever been arrested?
I'll drop if I don't sit down.
It's not very good.
Mary is Tom's daughter-in-law.
Cash donations will be accepted.
If you don't go, I won't, either.
What are you working on?
Don't stay up all night.

It's a no-brainer.
Tom just can't seem to get along with Mary.
I don't understand this sentence.
Don't let them go to waste.
We gather here once a week.
I see how you did that.
I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
He attempted suicide.
Bring your children with you.
When are you going back to your own country?
You look great in these photos.
We all want you back.
I live in this house by myself.
I bet you're busy.
I'm concentrating.
I lived in this house as a child.
Do I need this?
It was nothing less than a miracle.
I have to borrow some money.
He seems absorbed in his work.
I suggested that she go alone.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
I'm not ready to fight.
You're a liar.
I just want your love.
She offered her seat to an old woman.
She accompanied me on the piano.
What if somebody sees you?
Casualties were inevitable.
Don't you have a bicycle?
I think it's sad to not have any friends.
I have to show you something.
The enemy destroyed many of our ships.
We don't want to know.
You get out only what you put in.
Are you sure about that?
Don't you have a bicycle?
His proposal is completely out of the question.
To tell the truth, I'm not in favor of it at all.
No way!
Somehow or other I found his house.
I'll find out soon enough.
I was stunned.
I just know that I don't want to be married to you.
The blockade by Britain and the other allies was very successful.
You can call me at any time you like.
Tom set the bird free.
Don't get a stomachache by eating too much.
I didn't do what I was told to do.
Tom never apologized.
I survived.
We're unemployed.
I meet him from time to time.
I let you catch me.
You've been very kind to me.
She is still a girl.
I don't have the patience for this.
Won't you have some tea?
I've already tried that once.
I love that scarf.
How big you are!
How did you get so good at French?
They're cute.
Where did you learn all that?
She had already gone to bed when I phoned her at 11:00 p.m.
Who are you there with?
Let's sing a happy song.
I want you to talk.
I wanted to talk to you about something.

I don't believe in karma.

Do you sometimes go abroad on your holidays?
There are few books without misprints.
I am playing it safe.
He loves to party.
He's skilled at videogames.
When did you find out?
We have a colleague in Spain.
I am not your enemy.
All of a sudden, the fire alarm went off.
You hurt me.
You can rely on him.
I just have a few questions.
I need to borrow your pen.
He wiped the sweat from his brow.
I don't want you to enjoy it.
I just started to learn Esperanto.
I have seen her before.
I am baking bread.
Don't you know how dangerous it is to go swimming by yourself?
There's no class today.
You may call him a fool, but you cannot call him a coward.
She was close to breaking into tears.
Do you intend to answer all my questions truthfully?
Don't be a stranger.
Grow up a little.
Tom isn't really a teacher.
I'm doing the dishes.
You made the same mistake as last time.
I didn't sleep long enough.
She has nothing in common with him.
Let me help you.
These questions can be answered quite simply.
How much time did we lose?
You made my day.
I thought we weren't going to do this.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
Nothing is planned.
Do you think I'm right?
The answer is anything but simple.
Maybe we can find someplace to park further up the street.
Please put the chair away. It is in the way.
There is little hope that she will come on time.
Do you want to pray?
I think we both know why I'm here.
Tom doesn't know how to swim.
My husband is a good man.
I should've gone home.
I have a stomachache.
Why do you always seem to want to argue?
The tree was felled with one hard blow of his ax.
I'd do anything to protect you.
I have a lot to do today.
I may not have time.
I did do some checking.
I can't believe I never knew that.
I remember seeing this before.
I think you need to find yourself a part-time job.
I hardly see you anymore.
Why are you so insecure?
I'm only three years older than he is.
Tom took credit for my idea.
Is that unusual?
You don't have the guts.
The arrow missed its target.
It's good for us to eat vegetables every day.
The movie was really good.
Watch your toes.
Who picked you for this mission?
His explanation doesn't make sense at all.
But I wasn't afraid.
The car is parked in front of the building.
He got the job.
Is my laundry ready?
It is still light outside.
Tom can't play tennis.
I think it won't rain tomorrow.
I borrowed this comic book from his sister.
Did he go there?
I never imagined we'd end up like this.
I'll just go.
I'm going to get myself some coffee. Do you want some?
Have you ever had a serious illness?
Doesn't anyone want to speak to me?
Don't kid me!
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
I'm sorry I had to leave you alone.
We're both right.
Don't shoot!
I will need your help.
They revolted against the government.
I slept very well last night.
I have made up my mind to achieve my goals in three years.

I'll give you a call in the morning.
You ought not to miss it.
I hate everyone, and everyone hates me.
I'm not sure what happened.
There aren't any fish living in this river anymore.
My hobby is reading novels.
I don't know if this will be enough.
I couldn't tell her from sister.
I don't like this jacket.
That was cool.
I know him very well.
I just got out of a relationship.
Why didn't you come earlier?
Can you tell me where I am on this map?
He made a bad decision.
Could you stay and help me?
Please choose wisely.
The press is interested in his private life.
Let's build something.
You must make allowance for his lack of experience.
I saw Shin'ichi in Kakogawa yesterday.
Tom was the first person to arrive.
He seems happy.
Tom and Mary make a very nice couple.
He was wounded in the war.
Tom needs some new clothes.
Please be serious.
He had an accident at work.
Do turtles have teeth?
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo.
I'm not really that thirsty.
I'm done with you.
She can't do that.
Help yourself to a drink.
Honesty is a virtue.
We'll all be there.
I was stunned.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
A man began to follow Tom.
Let's walk to the bookstore.
I just don't want to let you down.
We must hurry.
If you don't want to go to that party, you don't have to.
Tom wouldn't really do that, would he?
Nothing is going to happen.
You should have told him about it while he was here.
Don't underestimate his determination.
Do you remember?
Were you born there?
They say that Firefox is downloaded over 8 million times a day.
I'm just a plain office worker.
He made the children laugh.
After their quarrel, she called it quits.
He will forever be in our hearts.
I just want a little more time.
We just want you to tell the truth.
Who is that woman?
This won't solve anything.
She goes jogging every morning before breakfast.
Let me finish, OK?
Stop! You're hurting him!
He never laughs.
You must stick to your diet.
He blew on the tip of his fingers.
She's busy now, so she can't talk with you.
I can't do this alone.
I never thought I'd see your face again.
I love comic books.
Do you have nightmares?
He can't explain what happened.
You should be more careful at a crosswalk.
I don't feel like playing cards.
Who do you think you are to speak to me that way?
I just got up. Give me a few minutes to get ready.
Did you say something?
If you were in my place, what would you do?
We had to stop.
I'm afraid you can't do that.
That restaurant serves excellent food.
I'm pleased with his performance.
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
My alarm clock didn't work. That's why I was late.
I will give you the money tomorrow.
I just followed the recipe.
I found the man I want to marry.
Tom is going to visit Mary tomorrow.
Because my mother is sick, my father will cook today.
Tom can't carry all those suitcases so you should help him.
Why were you absent yesterday?
People are getting antsy.
Something has gone terribly wrong.
I will drive you home.
You might get hurt.
We rested on some stones.
He couldn't help himself.
I had a stroke.
I never thought I'd see Tom again.
Are you listening?
Any amount of money will be welcome.
I suggest we change clothes first.
I regret saying that.
I can't believe it's Christmas already.
We haven't been to Boston in a long time.
I tried to warn you.
The fire reduced the whole village to ashes.
We wouldn't want to disobey the teacher, would we?
What is the correct answer?
You're too hard on yourself.
The two runners reached the finish line at the same time.
It wasn't a party.
Make your choice.
I must continue.
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
Let's not waste any more of each other's time.
The world doesn't revolve around you.
I'm not certain we can get tickets tonight.
Tom took Mary's money.
I was as surprised as you.
They embraced.
Why don't you talk to him?
I know you've been trying to help.
We found the front door locked.
I have a friend who can speak French.
He was writing a letter while listening to music.
You can also ride on an old, restored, steam train.
The pickpocket disappeared into the crowd.
What do you learn English for?
She called up her mother on the phone.
She hardly talks at all.
Some things just can't be explained.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
I'll keep you posted.
Tom really is a nice person, isn't he?
Ethnic minorities struggle against prejudice, poverty, and oppression.
It turned out that he was her father.
I'm saying no.
Do you want another one of these?
I really ought to go.
My mother allowed me to go abroad.
I just couldn't help myself.
That's what you should do.
Tom might not have a driver's license.
Tom pulled out his gun.
I had no intention of doing so.
There is a place for everyone in the world.
He boasts that he can speak six languages.
Will you tell him about it when he comes home?
I wish I had known how to do it.
I need some volunteers.
I find that very interesting.
Why didn't you call me last night?
We grow a variety of crops.
He lost his job.
We must ask the bank for the loan.
Do you think I'm qualified for that job?
She always stood by me.
It's a rental.
I was the last to know.
I wouldn't like to work in a hospital.
You have given me so many.
His oldest son is not married.
I outrank you.
He was shot 3 times in the arm.
I think Tom's number is unlisted.
Tom doesn't know what Mary means when she says that.
First of all, I'm very worried about my daughter's health.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
Silver costs less than gold.
Do I have to be hospitalized?
Chinese officials say economic growth has dropped to a three-year low because of the world economy.
Tom hasn't been married long.
Write something.
I showed her my room.
We gladly accept your offer.
I promise you I'll help you.
That strong light blinds me.
Tom wondered if it was true.
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
I'm not going to die.
I want to learn to sing like you.
What do you say we go for a swim?
We just have to be patient.
What are your orders?
Let's not get carried away.
Whoever told you that is a liar.
Stop the car.
No one expected him to be a candidate again.
Come here at exactly six o'clock.
They tried to cheer me up.
I would like to marry somebody like her.
The cost of living has increased drastically.
Why did Tom leave so suddenly?
He seems to have been ill.
I played an interesting game of chess against the computer last week.
My baby has a hereditary disease.
Can you tell me what you're doing here?
Wouldn't you like to drink some tea?
Take this medicine after each meal.
My brother went to the United States to study law.
They can't hear you.
You don't have to sing.
Someone asked for you.
Protesters were picketing outside the company's headquarters.
I have lived in Tokyo since 1985.
You should allow an hour to get to the airport.
That's what you always do.
I use it.
He's not one of us.
Here is your book.
I don't think that anybody really understands me.
I insist that he should go with us.
I've heard rumors about you and Tom.
You said you had a theory.
I'm shaken.
I cannot read French.
I will go, rain or shine.
I've never met a musician that I didn't like.
I'm back.
This might hurt.
He has spent ten years in jail for murder.
You work here, don't you?
It's way too heavy.
There is no life without water.
I admit there are a few problems.
You're the only person I know who can probably answer this question.
Tom carried his duffel bag on his shoulder.
Are you seriously thinking about not going?
What kind of changes do you want us to make?
You don't have the ticket.
I am good at math.
I'm worn out.
What a waste of water!
Is there any chance that you have eaten any of the contaminated food?
I'm glad to see you're happy.
Please correct the sentence.
How long does it take to your office from the airport?
He studied hard in order to get into college.
They stopped talking.
I have always considered you a close friend.
Your lives will be spared if you surrender.
Show me how to do this.
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.
Lock the door behind me.
Tom took a taxi to the hospital.
I want to speak.
What do you want to have?
The government is not doing its best to solve the housing problem.
Did I tell you that?
I'm too lazy to do my homework.
Include me in your plans.
She left the room.
It seemed like you weren't interested.
That's how he discovered the comet.
Sorry I couldn't come over yesterday. Something came up.
I think Tom could learn a lot from you.
I am not like you.
I've heard about it. Your parents disappeared, running out on their debt didn't they?
They all drowned.
He has left already.
He is able to swim like a fish.
Did you write that?
Figure it out yourself.
He's only a couple of years younger than me.
Hold this.
It was crowded here all last week.
I met him then for the first time.
I've got to learn to slow down.
I can't tolerate Tom's behavior.
They did not listen.
Do you have plans tonight?
You've got a pretty good memory.
It's yours if you want it.
He began to cry loudly.
What are you going to do tonight?
I was late.
Be polite to everyone.
I said so.
What am I supposed to tell Tom now?
You don't need that.
Sorry about the mess.
What reason did he give for being so late?
She misses her family a lot.
I owe you a big one for getting me out of the jam.
This used to be my room.
You need to be careful.
Which platform is it on?
I sold it for ten dollars.
He tied his dog up to the tree while he went into the store.
We need someone to keep an eye on our baby while we are away.
I have to run.
You're still green.
No more than 50 people came.
They'll be all right.
Tom followed me to the garage.
She has no self-esteem.
The basket was full of apples.
What do you think is going to happen?
You will need an armed escort.
I've done no such thing.
Your cat will survive.
I stayed at home because I was sick.
He prepared for his imminent departure.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
A dog bit her leg.
She borrowed the book from him.
I'm tired of dancing.
No one's shooting at us now.
You're bossy.
It's all over for us.
We must talk.
Are you sure that's necessary?
I hate her parents.
I don't have an opinion either way.
Soon nobody will have anything to do with you.
You don't need to be in such a hurry.
They can't hear you.
In terms of the pay you will get, is this a good job?
I never should've let you go home alone last night.
I have met him many times.
My school grades have been average.
He never tells a lie.
Tom scratched his name off the list.
I can't wait to meet him.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Get in. I'll drive you somewhere.
Where did you stay?
She has left her umbrella behind.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
She picked out a pink shirt for me to try on.
I know what you were hoping for.
Do you remember your grandfather?
Let's do it!
If I tell him the truth, she will never forgive me.
That store no longer sells cosmetics.
The painting is all but finished.
I'll treat you to dinner.
I'd like to have that gift wrapped.
You are in over your head.
I'm going back inside.
You're poisoning me.
We'll look into the case at once.
The hunter put ammunition in the gun.
We all knew that it would happen sooner or later.
I haven't seen them anywhere.
Are you so stupid that you can't see it?
At first, they were all convinced he was innocent.
Can you forget your native language?
She forced him to eat his vegetables.
Did you get the check?
Please air the futon.
What is that?
Do you know how fast you were going?
Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?
You can be pretty helpful when you want to be.
Do you know me?
It was a resounding success.
He must stay in the hospital for a week.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
I think Tom looks like John.
All the people present were moved by his speech.
He wants to study music and dance.
He did what he was told.
You can tell what a person is like by looking at his friends.
Tom had no way of verifying the information.
Something went wrong with my watch.
I talk to myself.
I deserved that.
I love traveling alone.
Draw a picture of yourself.
How could you not see this coming?
I'm pleased with his performance.
You can't imagine doing that, can you?
Tom didn't even want to eat.
How far is it from here?
It won't take long to finish the job.
I figured you'd be impressed.
I'm delighted to meet you.
Do whatever you want.
All right, listen carefully.
Ignorance is bliss.
I don't know what I owe you.
He did it for the money.
He asked me two questions.
You're biased.
We love our parks.
What's your favorite breakfast food?
I used to fish for hours on holidays.
Television helps us widen our knowledge.
Don't hesitate to ask questions.
I only went inside once.
You can eat whatever you like.
I don't talk about you behind your back.
Would you mind if we left?
He risked his life to save her.
I explained it to him.
I feel a sense of duty.
We must intervene.
I went to the park to play tennis.
Please copy this page.
I thought you went home.
He got more than he bargained for.
Why did it have to be us?
After eating dinner, I washed the dishes.
You must not be late for school.
I got on the wrong bus.
I want you to die.
I demand an explanation for this mistake.
Is it damaged?
I was impressed with what I saw.
Choose either of the two T-shirts.
Computers are capable of doing extremely complicated work.
Tom and Mary aren't home yet.
I enjoyed it very much.
It's a shortcut.
Is there anything we could do to help?
Do you want to get us both killed?
I admire him for his courage.
I can't think of anything to write about.
Hey, where did you two come from?
I want to know all the details.
Today, many people worry about losing their jobs.
A growing child who doesn't seem to have much energy perhaps needs medical attention.
I need a favor.
He has a tight schedule.
Be more precise.
I have never drawn anything in my life.
Let's ask.
I don't know anything about the future.
Who painted this?
This medicine will make you feel better.
I can't believe I'm here again.
I had some time to think about what I had to do.
He stuck to his promise.
Can you spell it?
He works for an American company.
Where's your house?
I personally believe that you're right.
Tom doesn't know where Mary wants to spend her summer vacation.
If it snows tomorrow, I'll build a snowman.
English is spoken in a lot of countries.
I don't want to play.
He used his head.
She gained weight.
A swarm of hornets attacked the children.
I've lost interest in golf.
Add two ounces of grated cheese.
What makes you think that Tom will listen to me?
Start reading where you left off.
How do you propose to do that?
That was sweet.
I knew that already.
I told everyone to duck.
People do that all the time.
Can I have your phone number?
She drowned herself in some lake.
Tom pretended not to know what to do.
We're very happy.
You may use my pen at any time.
Printing ink is in short supply.
That's what my friends keep telling me.
I don't know what that means.
They missed the train.
I must hurry.
I want to teach you something.
Will he come this evening?
I never told anyone.
We had a real good time.
It is no use asking me for money.
I live in comfort.
You must go and see the headmaster at once.
I got up very late this morning.
I'm not alone.
He was struck off the list.
Whose bed is that?
As soon as I finish writing the report, I'll send it to you.
Are you a Japanese student?
I hope you brought coffee.
Most of us are much more interesting than the world suspects.
Are you a Buddhist?
I promise you I'll come early.
The worst is over.
His request was equivalent to an order.
Little remains to be done.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
I don't care what you do with your money.
He put up a notice about the change in price.
I see her sweeping the room.
I think we can do this without any extra help.
She opened the letter quickly.
Your English has improved considerably.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
It was the only thing to do.
I want that.
You're too tense.
They cultivated the land.
We were beaten.
He decided not to go.
I don't know which of you is older.
For here, or to go?
I beg your pardon. I didn't quite catch your name.
I'm studying very hard.
She's been in the hospital for a month.
Tom died trying to save a child from a burning building.
Can I have this orange?
You may stay here as long as you like.
I don't know exactly where.
I'm very glad to see you again.
The time has come for you to play your trump card.
Tom didn't drink the milk Mary poured for him.
They forgot to lock the door.
We could walk.
He suddenly fell ill.
The lake water is very cold.
You're really incredible.
You're kind of cute when you're mad.
What else can you tell us?
I just want to talk with you a little while.
Those are my books.
Tom concealed his anger from Mary.
I only know what you tell me.
I'm on duty.
No matter how hard I try, I can't do it any better than she can.
I don't want to be late for work.
Something is grating on her nerves.
I'm not certain.
You can get from Washington to New York by train.
Some people gain weight when they stop smoking.
Some continue to work part time, while others do volunteer work.
Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
Stand back!
I read a lot of books last summer.
This makes no sense to me.
This is not a trap.
You're unforgettable.
He will be delighted to see you.
It was snowing.
I don't understand why she doesn't love me anymore.
Don't you find it interesting?
You're very clever.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
He is still sitting on the bench.
She must have visited England last summer.
Is Tom working?
He paused to look at the poster.
It seems to me that you are honest.
I don't know when he'll come back.
I'm a terrible writer.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
I haven't made a decision yet.
He showed me how to make a cake.
I think Tom needs your help.
That is completely useless.
You will have to work a lot.
How many times a day do you feed your dog?
I stayed home to rest.
My plan is different from yours.
I don't think I'll go today.
She persuaded him to do it even though she knew it wasn't a good idea.
I'm sorry I broke my promise.
They want peace.
He whispered something to her.
I apologize for not replying right away.
Mary carries pepper spray in her purse.
I took a week off.
Stay away from him!
I can't help but feel like I've forgotten something.
She knows herself well.
Aliens are often depicted with dark, almond-shaped eyes.
When did this occur?
Tom's a beginner, but he catches on fast.
The government's investment will create many jobs.
That's not my concern.
It's not a secret.
Tom was one of the invited guests.
I saw everything.
I heard someone calling me from a distance.
I chose him a nice tie.
It looks really good.
I feel faint.
As soon as she saw me, she burst out crying.
Where did you go for spring break?
No one would listen.
Last night, we heard sounds of gunshots and screaming on the street outside our window.
Mary is young and attractive.
It's high time you left for school, isn't it?
We have equipped our office with computers.
I was just leaving home then.
It is very kind of you to send me such a nice present.
Can I borrow your computer?
Tom knew Mary's husband before she got married.
Tom will never agree to that.
I suppose you want to use my office.
He says he has a bone to pick with you.
That blouse fits you well.
I unlocked the door.
Will you take a personal check?
There is no escape.
My baby brother still wets his bed.
You and I have the same idea.
Tom was determined to finish the job before he went home.
Television is ruining family life.
I'm in way over my head.
My wife is hiding something from me.
Have you ever known them to come on time?
He has come out of his shell.
I have a lot to do today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to have this discussion at another time.
I just want to be alone.
What were you doing before this?
I ate breakfast at eight.
Why do you want to study abroad?
Half of the bananas in the basket were rotten.
Don't worry. I can fix it.
I think I'm ready to leave.
Can I talk with you?
I didn't know tofu was this tasty.
In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground.
He took an oral examination.
Whose turn is it?
She sat next to him and listened quietly.
You need to be more careful from now on.
Have you eaten supper yet?
We were unable to make contact with them until it was too late.
We all work.
I wish you could have come with me.
I never want to see you again.
He would sit and look at the sea for hours.
How long have you known about this?
He handed in his resignation to his boss.
I'm back in business.
He lives in this neighborhood.
He kicked him while he was down.
Life isn't all roses and sunshine.
I knew we forgot something.
I wish I had a friend like you.
There's something I have to ask you.
"How soon will the bus come?" "In five minutes."
Tom gave me thirty dollars.
She will be back at five.
I don't have that kind of money.
Why couldn't you come yesterday?
I was scolded by my teacher.
Rest is important.
Are you American?
My uncle has completely recovered from his illness.
I want to go out tonight.
I've never seen such a large whale.
Don't wait up.
Don't waste my time asking stupid questions.
Does your mom know?
I lost interest.
Can you please translate this for me?
He had dinner by himself.
Birds are natural enemies of insects.
I had hardly left home when it began to rain heavily.
I don't want you to change.
Don't swear in public.
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance.
Tom expected to leave early in the morning, but he overslept.
He vowed to give up smoking.
I wish you had told me that.
The plants were damaged by the frost.
We don't need him.
I never said I didn't want you.
What time does it close?
I want to get as far away from here as I can.
You've set a bad example.
Let's visit some temples tomorrow.
I did the right thing.
You dropped something.
It's necessary for you to go.
They made him work.
Let's go for a ride in my car.
It's taking us way too much time to get this job finished.
The bell had already rung when I got to school.
Have you ever been lonely?
Did you find out what time the meeting starts?
Do your homework right away.
Are you tired of waiting in line?
You must get the job done before the deadline.
No one is amused.
I got remarried.
You're going to be very proud of me.
I'm glad you're OK again.
I suppose anything's possible.
We're not giving up.
You made Tom cry.
They changed it very recently.
I must obey.
I thought Tom had a soccer game tonight.
What was the time of death?
Are you seriously thinking about starting your own business?
I had to wait for Tom to finish.
The fuel gauge is broken.
Go away before they see you here.
We must talk privately.
That's a great poem.
I can't do this myself.
We must finish everything before Tuesday morning.
You can't blame me.
A plastic dish will melt on the stove.
The park is located in the center of the city.
I don't like people like Tom.
Green is the color of money.
Are you a student?
He'll know the secret sooner or later.
I want you to have this.
He had one of his socks on inside out.
I will work.
I'd been on my own all week and was starving for conversation.
What's your favorite television program?
Few people think so.
What's your theory on what happened?
My glass is full.
I took your umbrella by mistake.
They strolled along the beach.
He had the last laugh.
We'll fail.
The hotel is run by his uncle.
Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think that something like this would happen.
I hope that everything is okay.
Where's your school?
How many boys are there in the room?
I got goosebumps.
You can't blame him.
I don't ever want to hurt you.
Please call before you come.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Are you on your way home?
I'm not good at classifying things.
Don't come into my room.
I liked your idea and adopted it.
Tom could no longer control himself.
I am ashamed of my son's conduct.
I wanted to remember.
This plant is good to eat.
I just don't want any of these.
Lake Baikal in Russia is the deepest lake in the world.
He is going to the concert.
Wasn't he your boyfriend?
Am I seeing things?
That's your choice.
Seriously?
He lived there all by himself.
I don't need an office.
I heard you switched majors.
I can see that now.
I had no idea you were so ruthless.
I'd be very grateful if you could help me.
This is his.
I don't know what you really want.
He is my type!
You're new here, aren't you?
Are you insured?
Tom kissed Mary and she slapped him.
You don't want to go down this road.
It was so good.
Few people can speak a foreign language perfectly.
He felt the same way as I did.
Your wish will come true in the near future.
They're all safe.
Tom wasn't very impressed.
I am sorry if I disturbed you.
I had a feeling you would be late.
I can come if you want.
Where is the entrance to the museum?
We should call the police.
I think this is delicious.
We all die.
The two politicians met face to face for the first time.
She will make a business trip to London next week.
Company attorneys are working around the clock to complete the merger.
My brother was threatened by someone waving a gun.
I took a shower and then went to bed.
I think we'd better help Tom.
I never said you were lying.
Choose carefully.
I kept my mouth shut.
He makes it a point to remember each one of our birthdays.
This is not my specialty.
He is beyond hope.
When can I call you?
They were abandoned by their mother.
There was almost no color in his face.
Everyone did a fabulous job.
You don't have to answer.
Someone turned the alarm off.
Banks open at nine o'clock.
They're not a threat.
She heard him scream, so she ran into his bedroom.
I got sick of the constant noise of the street traffic.
The house was struck by lightning yesterday.
She told him that her father had died.
He wore old shoes.
I'll pack my bag.
He wanted to know more about the trees, too.
I just can't stop crying.
Did something happen between you and Tom?
The meeting started with some general chit-chat to break the ice.
Did you bring a weapon?
The phone was off the hook.
How long have you been out of prison?
I liked your dancing.
Traveling is easy these days.
He is a gentleman.
What season do you like the best?
My daughter has reached a marriageable age.
You look nervous.
I once worked in a restaurant.
Did you hear the roar of the lions?
Quit behaving like a kid.
I can't give you anything.
The accident happened because he wasn't careful.
Stay calm and do your best.
They're part of us.
Walk this way.
The boys were as nervous as the girls.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
Tom isn't sure he wants to do this.
I like speaking in French.
I fell down and hurt my wrist.
Have you ever ridden a horse?
Even though it's small, it's still my apartment.
This could take a while.
Let Tom answer.
You made the same mistake.
We've only got three more days.
Are you mentally ill?
I think we should talk about this now.
I'll leave the decision to you.
Hold on for a few minutes, will you?
I feel it's a tad risky to do that.
He was listening to the music in his room.
Where did they go?
There's no escape.
Were you at home yesterday?
He pretended to be my friend.
It makes me nervous.
In 1975, Angola became a free nation.
Are you about done?
How many have you had?
How does your opinion differ from his?
You will have a new sister.
Get into your car.
How long were you at the party?
I'd like to get started right away.
How was your summer?
This book is both interesting and instructive.
Tom is Mary's fiancé.
I hope that I can do it.
Do you know how his father died?
My mother is busy cooking dinner.
I don't want to spend any more time than necessary cleaning the house.
You were dying, but the doctor saved your life.
This is exactly what I didn't want to happen.
Look at that dog.
This coffee tastes great.
Please let me come with you.
They slept in the same bed.
I wish Tom the best.
I just got my textbooks for this semester.
They are very interested in astronomy.
We got stuck in traffic.
He disliked school.
I'll just wait.
All good things come to an end.
His sister is not going to America.
That school looks just like a prison.
I had loads of fun.
I'm a fan of German opera.
How I've missed you!
Who painted these pictures?
Get ready for some action.
I go to Osaka by bus.
I believe Tom can do that.
My dream went up in smoke.
Do you really think Tom can hear us?
The public demands answers.
They showed it to our company.
I hope that your brother is better.
I enjoyed this book.
I wouldn't do that for all the money in the world.
I never imagined meeting you here.
That's all I need to hear.
You'll get another chance.
Are you sure he can do this?
I really enjoyed last night.
He has already gone home.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
It's so different now.
I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.
I should've said I was busy.
Her anger is understandable.
She works as a nurse in the local hospital.
Since she got her braces, I've hardly seen her smile.
We were destined to meet one day.
You're nice.
His advice didn't help at all.
What are you doing here anyway?
Do you have something for me?
Don't play games with me.
She accepted his offer.
It makes sense.
I had a horrible dream last night.
He won't make it.
I volunteered.
Jackson seemed to get better.
Who killed Tom?
She used to pray before going to bed.
He didn't see anything.
I'll be there at five p.m.
Could you check the tire pressure?
We've got a mystery to solve.
The train leaves at nine.
I am doing my homework.
Don't worry. We'll figure everything out.
I'll give you to the count of three.
I'm used to no one liking me.
He was elected chairman.
I had no sooner closed the door than somebody started knocking on it.
She cremated him against his wishes.
He caught a terrible cold.
Your cat is overweight.
I just want you to know that I won't be able to come to your picnic.
He has built up an excellent business.
She studied English in the morning.
Wait till six.
A gigantic bird came flying toward him.
Do your best.
He speaks English better than I do.
You never asked why.
Do you live in this dorm?
You're not normal.
It was not my intention.
Please be careful.
You better hurry.
Where were you yesterday?
They left the room one by one.
I don't read newspapers much.
That incident made him famous.
Please don't tell anyone I was here.
I was off duty at the time.
He's always at home on Mondays.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
I sell shoes.
We can't tow this car.
She failed to appear.
The woman who he thought was his aunt was a stranger.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
Tom is only three weeks old.
I love it.
I can hardly imagine him going abroad.
Stay away from my daughter.
Today is Wednesday.
I told Tom to take off his shoes.
I get arrested from time to time.
You're very curious.
I want to live forever.
Does anybody know how the fire started?
I bet you didn't know that.
You can't get rid of it.
Some day we'll take a trip to India.
Either they don't want to or they can't.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
Could you be more specific?
Do you have Saturday off?
Should I go or would you like me to stay?
There have been a lot of complaints about the way Tom behaves.
That's it. I've done all I can do.
Can your mother drive a car?
I remember when I first saw you.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
It's unlikely that that movie will make a lot of money.
You'll find the book in the library.
What time did your friend go home?
I'll handle the rest.
The city wants to extend the road.
I learned to milk a cow.
She did not visit me on Sunday but on Monday.
I'm not interested in that.
Tom works for a translation agency.
She had the kindness to help me.
Can you give us your point of view?
He would like to take part in the contest.
You're so predictable.
Tom said he was ill, which was a lie.
School begins in April.
I never saw such a woman.
I drove the car into the garage.
He has a big restaurant near the lake.
You're not that interesting.
This won't happen again.
I really want Tom to stop doing that.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Did you sleep all right?
It's more fun than drinking coffee.
I am ready to follow you.
You may come in now.
Please don't smoke cigarettes no matter what.
Tom kept silent all day.
Mary is very attached to the little girl.
You've been very kind to me.
I hate them all.
This is Tom's locker.
We are influenced by our environment.
I didn't say you did that.
No one was in the room.
They painted their toenails.
Tom wanted to say goodbye to Mary.
Why do you want to be a doctor?
This cake is sweet.
I'm looking for a job.
Where will you be?
I can solve the problem by myself.
You can't trust anything he says.
I didn't really want to win.
Further investigation is required.
That distinction was well-deserved.
He did it right away.
Open your hand.
I'm happy you liked it.
They were admiring themselves.
If you have a question, please raise your right hand.
I've already hidden the diamonds.
We're ruthless.
We need it.
She showed me around the campus.
I only wish I could see you more often.
I'm in danger.
I often use SSH to access my computers remotely.
When I'm with you, I'm happy.
The man is starving.
They rented the upstairs room to a student.
I always buy expensive items on credit.
However hard you try, you can't finish it in a week or so.
I won't do that unless you want me to.
Who will come with me?
That's probably true.
I want a piece of chocolate cake.
He looked satisfied with my explanation.
Tom is learning to swim.
I think you're right.
I don't know what that's all about.
She left me a note.
Are they cops?
Playing cards is fun.
She is in her hotel now.
Tom has to stay in Boston this weekend.
I wish you two the best.
Everybody likes her.
Tom could stop this.
Don't tell her about it.
Why did Tom want it?
I've never even told my wife.
Let's keep in touch with each other.
She emerged from the kitchen.
Against the snow, the white rabbit was invisible.
I called for help.
You have to disappear.
Tom asked me whether I was hungry.
I have a fear of the dark.
Who are you supposed to be?
I don't see how you can ignore this.
I feel blue.
A good password should be difficult to guess, but easy to remember.
I'm your best friend.
Are you for or against the war?
Telephone booths are very scarce around here.
He pushed the cat into the swimming pool.
Let's get back on topic.
It's a pleasure to be here.
I enjoyed talking with him at the party.
You've been drinking, haven't you?
Did you read what I wrote?
Go home now.
Do you not like them?
I want to be involved.
Do your job.
I thought you were smart.
We can't compete with that.
Tom doesn't trust us.
Here are some letters for you.
What did I win?
You don't know how lucky you are.
You're just like your father.
All of my children live in Boston.
He admitted that he was guilty.
Thanks a million.
You might want to grab some sleep.
It's not raining yet.
You haven't eaten, have you?
I read the book.
I don't like to talk about Tom.
I've had the time of my life.
He is cranky.
I was shaken.
I was bored with his speech.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
She made me cookies.
Why did I trust you?
Let me handle it.
Through genetic engineering, corn can produce its own pesticides.
Tom became extremely weak.
I can prove it to you.
It's outdated.
Who discovered America?
Wash your hands well.
We went on a picnic together.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
Clerks with sticky fingers won't keep their jobs for long.
She hired him as a programmer.
They could only listen.
After English, German is the most popular foreign language in Russia.
They have no natural predators.
He was perfect.
Are you able to type?
I am ready to go with you.
I'll wait here for you.
I entered someone else's room by mistake.
We're all crazy.
Do you think you could be a cop?
She was about to go out.
You can't keep this a secret.
I have almost no appetite.
He whipped out his sword.
I felt sad.
I heard them coming.
Please think it over and let me know your decision.
You know what song I want to sing.
Tom looked very concerned.
I hear that you are having an unusually cold winter.
What is the tallest mountain in Europe?
He's already left.
That's a beautiful piece of meat.
Everybody looked nervous.
I really do hope we can still be friends.
It was personal.
Give me your belt.
I sometimes skate.
You gotta get more organized.
I just panicked.
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones.
I think Tom wants Mary's job.
She wasn't able to meet him.
He's mad at his daughter.
The court found him guilty.
I agree with you on this point.
Let's visit my grandpa this weekend.
Please remove your shoes before entering the house.
Compare your translation with his.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
You shouldn't be in here.
Give me some water, please.
He has rough manners.
Any child can do that.
You don't have to read the whole thing from beginning to end.
He's not going.
It's there to the left.
There is no need for him to work.
I had to cancel that order because we didn't have enough money to pay for it.
What time is it?
If for some reason a man stopped thinking, that man would no longer be a man.
I lost everything I had.
They say that you never forget your first love.
We volunteered.
Everyone is drunk.
She is guilty of fraud.
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it.
It rained during the night.
Tom got out of prison after 30 years.
Mary is charming.
How many times do you think you've eaten here?
There's no money.
You didn't come here alone, did you?
Everyone is waiting in the other room.
Do not say such foolish things.
You're not helping me.
I know what this is.
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
Would you say it once more?
Tom is extremely patient.
You're so talented.
Don't be so lazy.
What you're doing makes me nervous.
I thought you'd gone and left me.
I find you attractive.
Some people laugh at his jokes, but others don't.
I tried it.
I'm different.
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk.
I don't compromise.
Hello, Tom. Good morning.
She waited for you for two hours.
I'm a bit tired.
Metal spoons are generally made of stainless steel.
A cat was sleeping in the bass drum.
We ran around the park.
She advised him to catch the first train in the morning.
There is a right time for everything.
She is able to skate.
It's not your fault.
A walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Is this time different?
The rescue workers arrived two hours too late.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
Wait till the light turns green.
Tom had a little accident.
You have dirty feet.
You must be back before ten.
I gave you fair warning.
We admire her for her bravery.
She is my girlfriend.
Do not give in to those demands.
His nose bled.
I can't forgive him for behaving like that.
The contract was signed.
The bridge is being repainted.
My dad is the best dad in the world.
Show me how it works.
Was Tom asked to leave?
Do you want something cold to drink?
There's nothing fun about that.
I have a problem.
I'm asking you as a friend.
I really appreciate your coming.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Things got out of hand.
I'll just get you started.
I'm a beginner, too.
My brother eats twice as much as I do.
She started pursuing him before he became famous.
I want to hold you.
Do you take me for a fool?
I ruined everything.
He lives close by.
I used to think it didn't really matter what I fed my dog.
He's a nonsmoker.
She calmed down.
I'd like to give Tom something special for his birthday.
How do you want me to do that?
Come along with me.
It's a bit cold, but it probably isn't worth putting the heater on yet.
It's a bargain.
Do as you like.
He spoke of the people and the things that he had seen during his trip.
The teacher got well again.
I've tried everything I know of.
My father is always forgetting things.
I wrote to her last month.
All are present.
I don't remember the last time I climbed a tree.
I find foreign languages very interesting.
He began to run.
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be singled out for a full body search.
The girl was visibly shaken after the accident.
You're really annoying.
We're experienced.
Would you say they match?
I hope that it'll work.
I'd like to take my jacket off.
Nobody could explain how the thing was made.
This is an express train. It won't make many stops.
What do you have in mind?
Put your room in order.
Ah, that's much better.
I'm out of gas.
I found these.
A conductor directs an orchestra.
He came home very late.
Please cut along the dotted line.
You don't know who I am.
I share your feelings.
Let no one escape.
If it doesn't rain soon, our garden is going to dry up.
I think that's a stupid idea.
I really have no idea.
You won't believe who came by today.
I dislike eggs.
Don't you want to say anything?
I found somebody.
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
What do you have to add to 17 to get 60?
She dressed like a boy.
Don't feed the animals.
The odds are in his favor.
Tom refused to settle down.
I'll take it into consideration.
The proof is in the pudding.
I think you're going to survive.
Why do you need it?
The storm raged in all its fury.
Which way is the beach?
What do you think happens then?
This room doesn't get much sunshine.
I shouldn't have put my laptop so close to the edge of the table.
Don't take it personally.
I go jogging.
Who picked you for this job?
This is for internal use.
Congress passed the bill.
How do you think you're doing?
I don't like big dogs.
We talk frequently.
They are all alike to me.
He is absorbed in his work.
We may have missed the bus.
I want you to go back.
We get on OK.
I don't think that Tom can speak French.
It won't work.
Honesty is not always the best policy.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
How long will it stop there?
We were on the same train by chance.
Wash your hands before eating.
He didn't get paid for it.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
We're all OK.
When did she leave the classroom?
I pointed my camera at her.
Tell the truth no matter what.
Mary is being careful with her baby.
Could you come and see me tomorrow?
I'm not offended.
I don't want you to be upset.
He was attracted to the woman.
I really like puppies.
The mere thought of it is enough to make me happy.
She likes painting pictures.
It seems that the rainy season has set in.
Her condition grew worse last night.
What are your plans for the night?
Tom and Mary are getting married in October.
He owns a dishwasher.
I've got no reason to stay.
This is a very time-consuming task.
Can you direct me to the post office?
She has a hot temper.
I haven't eaten lunch yet.
There you are.
He was never to see his homeland again.
Would you say they match?
He put on the black coat.
If I'd only taken the time to read the instruction manual!
We'll pay for it.
Could you put this bag somewhere else?
I can't force you to do anything.
Get back here.
I can prove it to you.
They are Russian.
You feel lonesome, don't you?
Tom wants you to do him a favor.
You don't expect me to face Tom alone, do you?
I will give you whatever you want.
The door is locked at nine every night.
They were yours.
What's your favorite number?
You have the same camera as mine.
I think you're funny.
He did the reverse of what I asked.
I've been here since Saturday.
He will also go.
We must do it quickly.
This bed is heavy.
I can't believe you would do that to me.
You don't look pleased to see me.
I changed the arrangement of the furniture in my room.
Let's go by taxi, OK?
That man is a soldier.
Dozens of students gathered there.
I thought you had it all figured out.
Where's your family, Tom?
You'd better go to see your family doctor at once.
I was always interested in art.
I asked for a seat in the smoking section.
I can't accept your gift.
I get a lot of satisfaction out of my work.
Whose pencil is this?
I hope I can hold on to my job.
I think Tom is loyal.
Your house needs painting.
These cookies are star-shaped.
Let's take a look at this.
You have a pretty good memory.
I should not have done that. It was wrong.
You probably don't remember me.
It's the correct answer.
